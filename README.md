# 360iDev2020-sysDiagnose

Hi!  Welcome to the presentation for my 360iDev 2020 talk on sysDiagnose!

I'll add files and any errata I come across after the talk. ~~When the fine folks at 360iDev releases the video, I'll add that here as well.~~ Videos added, in two formats: the m4v is the raw presentation; the mp4 is "as delivered" with some Q&A at the end.

Thanks for visiting!
